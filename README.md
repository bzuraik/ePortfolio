# ePortfolio

This program is simply a portfolio of different investments so that the user can keep track of the actions for buying or selling investments,
searching for relevant investments, updating prices, and calculating the total gain of the portfolio.
the general problem im trying to solve is to combined all the investemnt in one place and make it easier for the user
to acceses their investments.
